## Crime Mapping Software

Everyday someone moves locals, students conduct analytical research, and companies look at potential areas to expand and set up new locations. Part of their consideration process is the safety and crime statistics of an area. With the wealth of information available at our fingertips you would imagine that a "one-stop-shop" would exist that concisely illustrates the safety of an area. Although many platforms do exist to represent the presumed safety of an area generally presented as a map with varying colors to illustrate high crime areas; little to none show the end user the statistical data that led to the determination of real or perceived safety. A gap exists between the end user and those that created the software programs that exist. The gap being that an end user may want to know specifically the types of crime that an area is prone to better prepare or prevent such an incident from occurring.

### Database access.
Using databases from local and federal law enforcement can assist in providing a direct link between users and the information they desire. Law enforcement agencies use a variety of databases to catalog a variety of crimes and where they have taken place. By creating a software which searches daily for updated records users can see relevant crime information based on their area of choice. Although many of these databases contain sensitive information, a user agreement could be implemented to allow the software authoring company to access and utilize specific information for the program while ensuring sensitive information stays compartmentalized. The program could use an algorithm to only pull information from cases with closed investigations or arrest records since arrest records are open to the public. Furthermore, the database linking software can be linked to the Department of Justice's Sex Offender registry to include registered sex offenders and their geographic location. 

###Initial Implementation.
The initial product or beta would be best implemented in an area with a concise historical archive of arrests and crimes that took place in an area. The office of public records can be a starting point for any information that is required to accurately depict an areas predisposition to crime. The office of public records is the data warehouse that stores all arrest and investigation records as well as a myriad of other records that the public can access. Just because public access is allowed does not mean that a user will want to personally take on an endeavor of sifting through thousands of records just to get a bit of information that they need. This is where the software will play its part. Internal structures of the program can iterate throughout the database systematically querying information and then compiling it into an easy to interpret graphical user interface also known as a GUI. 

### Graphical User Interface.
The use of a GUI would dramatically improve the readability as well as the user-friendliness of the application.  Generally, if information is not presented in an "up-front" fashion, users will be deterred from using the program due to the perceived difficulties of retrieving data. A GUI that is simple to understand and use should reedy this potential issue. A map that can be moved to zoom in and out of areas or traverse across the geographic local should is the linchpin of the program and should be incorporated into the functionality. This map will allow the users to decide exactly where to look and pin point areas of high crime based. The map should have an option to filter specific data into or out of a query of a desired location. A heat-map can display crime-centric areas for focused searching and to easily remove a potential are of interest without wasting time. A sidebar can be used to control search filters, area filters, and map filters. This sidebar can also be used to access other parts of the program such as user login, settings management, and populate information about the origin location of data being represented in the map. A dialog box should appear when a user clicks on an icon to display all information associated with that icon. Users can have the option to drop pins or locational markers on the map using a toolbox that should be conveniently located within the sidebar.  The toolbox will contain common functions such as the ability to edit text size or color. A legend will be displayed on the map to elaborate on any used icons and their meaning. The toolbox will allow users to turn on or off certain features such as the legend. 

### Records Display. 
Using the toolbox and map in conjunction with each other will provide users the ability to populate crimes in the form of icons on the map. Each icon will be specific to the type of crime that was committed. The icons may group related crimes under one icon to reduce clutter on the map. As previously mentioned, a dialog box containing the full detailed report relating to a selected icon should appear when a user clicks an icon. A filtering option for misdemeanor and felony crimes will be accessible through the sidebar and will allow a user to tailor how much information they want returned. These records will only be limited by the amount of information accessible through whatever the originating crime database offers. 

###Icons.
Icons have been mentioned previously and this paragraph is intended to further elaborate on the design and usage of icons. The plethora of charges both misdemeanor and felony, results in the possibility of cluttering a map or ambiguity in the meaning of icons if there are too many variations. To deescalate this possibility, grouping methods should be used to determine what crimes should be represented. Using an overarching icon such as an icon that includes all variations of violent crimes would decrease the afore mentioned possibilities. The icon, once clicked, will list the exact charges of the individual who was arrested in a dialog box. An example would be a user sees the icon for violent crime and once selected, the exact charges populate such as assault with a deadly weapon for instance. This can be done with most crimes such as theft, sexual assault, and other groups of related charges. 

###Contingency to Databases.
Not all agencies will allow the public to access records from their databases as previously mentioned. An alternative to direct access to a preexisting database would be to create an internal database that is managed by the authoring company of the software. Depending on the scope of the program i.e. city, state specific this could be an unlikely expectation due to the sheer amount of records that would need to be input and updated regularly. If it is unfeasible to maintain this database, limitations to records available will be put in place that are congruent to the amount of updating that can be reasonably expected from a department. 

###Future Expansion and Incorporation of Functionality.
Depending on the success of the program, the functionality can be expanded even further to include other relevant features including emergency response information, and natural disaster relief information. Based on a user’s registered location or through accessing their GPS technology, area specific messages could be sent to user. Through coordination with natural disaster relief centers and agencies, users could be sent locations of what to do in the event of a disaster or the locations of food, water, and medical aid facilities following a disaster. Recovery and rescue teams could use this program to pinpoint locate individuals in need which ultimately will decrease inefficient search methods and result in more lives being saved. A recent function used by mobile cellular providers is to send mass messages to notify of amber alerts but that is not always a foolproof method of disseminating time sensitive information across the widest available platform. This would be an alternative method that can be used to reach users even if cellular services are not active i.e. using WIFI only enabled devices. 


###Conclusion.
This program could provide the missing link to a person's housing search; companies could realistically evaluate the growth potential of an area based on crime factors and make strategic decisions of where to set up their next future office; and students would have a reliable resource to use for projects, research, and dissertations. Without knowledge of what to expect and prepare for regarding safety, and what our children will be exposed to, we as a society will continue to propagate a vicious cycle of crime. This program does not just target a specific group of individuals for applicability. This program targets a core need that is vital to anyone’s existence; safety.
